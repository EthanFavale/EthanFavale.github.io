<h1 style="color: #FF5733;">My name is Ethan Favale</h1>
<p style="color: #5F4B8B;">I'm enrolled in this course to earn both an associate's degree and a certificate in cyber security. In my spare time, I like to play video games and hang out with my girlfriend of six years. Hell Divers 2 is the video game I'm playing right now.</p>
